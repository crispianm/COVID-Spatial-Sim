/*
 This is a self contained class within which ints can be aggregated to save memory.
 Note that each call needs to use the correct l_bound and u_bound - no record of where
 the numbers "are" is kept.  Any such record would add to the size of the class and thus
 negate a lot of the reason for having it!

 Usually will be used with compiler option /D SR_BYTEPACKED so as to leave a faster, larger
 version of the code.
